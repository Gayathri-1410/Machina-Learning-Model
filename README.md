project overview:

The project involves building a spam email detection model using Naive Bayes classifier, trained on a labeled dataset of emails. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess its classification performance.

key objectives:

The key objectives are to preprocess the email dataset by transforming text into numerical features using CountVectorizer, and then train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict spam vs. ham emails. The model is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance. Additionally, a confusion matrix is used to visualize the classification results.

python libraries:

The Python libraries used in the project include Pandas for data manipulation and loading the dataset,Scikit-learn for model building, training, and evaluation, and Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizing the confusion matrix. Additionally, CountVectorizer from Scikit-learn is used for transforming text data into numerical features, and LabelEncoder is used to encode categorical labels.
